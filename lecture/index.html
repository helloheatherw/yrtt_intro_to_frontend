slide-title: Aims

- To know what Responsive Design is
- To know how to use Media Queries to apply different styles depending on conditions
- To be familiar with some of Chrome's developer tools which can assist in designing responsively
- To understand what a CSS framework is
- To be able to create a responsive grid layout using a CSS framework

slide-title: What do we mean by ‘Responsive Design’ ?


- How people consume internet pages completely changed overnight with the creation of the iPhone

- The variety of devices that can now ‘browse the web’ includes tablets, phones, microwaves, fridges, televisions etc etc

- It meant that the web pages had to be re-thought for a variety of screen sizes and consumers

---

slide-title: What do we mean by ‘Responsive Design’ ?

Responsive design is allowing your website to "respond" to the screen it is currently displayed on.

Best observed with an example:

- BBC in 2003 - https://web.archive.org/web/20031101000000*/www.bbc.co.uk

- BBC in 2018 - https://web.archive.org/web/20180601000000*/www.bbc.co.uk

Much of ‘being responsive’ is actually achieved with CSS

---

slide-title: Introducing the CSS Media Query

- A media query is a piece of CSS that ONLY gets applied if a condition is met

- One of the early uses was to allow developers to apply different styles when the document was being rendered for **print**

```css

@media only screen and (min-width: 1000px) {
  body {
    background-color: lightblue;
  }
}

```

---

slide-title: Applying multiple media queries

- Let's add a media query for the condition `min-width: 1000px` wide and change the background colour

- Add more media queries, for page widths of 800, 600, 400, and 200px. Give each one a different background colour.

- At width 500px, which media query conditions match? Which one is applied?

---

slide-title: Task

- Hide an element on a "mobile" (narrow) screen width

- (Hint: the CSS property 'display' may be helpful here!)

---

slide-title: Creating a grid layout

- 12 column layout

- Columns are defined by fractions of this 12 column grid

---

slide-title: How can we achieve a grid layout?

- CSS Grid (most modern, not supported in all browsers)
- CSS Flexbox (modern, generally widely supported in browsers)
- CSS table layout (old school - not recommended!)

Frameworks:
- Bootstrap
- Material UI
- Bulma
- Semantic UI

---

slide-title: What is a CSS Framework?

- CSS that someone else has written

- It's just a CSS file!

- You just need to use the correct classes and markup

---


slide-title: Introducing Bootstrap

- A CSS Framework originally created by Developers at Twitter

- [https://getbootstrap.com/](https://getbootstrap.com/)

- Responsive is built-in

- Components and layout (12-column grid system)

---

slide-title: Bootstrap Grid system

- Containers, Rows and Cols

- Bootstrap includes a responsive, mobile first fluid grid system that lets you split the screen up into 12 columns and lets you customise the size of your HTML element as a fraction of 12.

- It uses a series of containers, rows and columns to lay out and align content.

.center[![Cols](./images/cols.png)]

---

slide-title: Boostrap Grid system

- Bootstrap makes it easy to center content on your page and provide sensible page margins. To do this we make use of the container class.

```html
<body>
  <div class="container">

  </div>
</body>
```

---

slide-title: Boostrap Grid system

- Bootstrap works on a grid layout, with 12 columns that make up the page. 

- If you do not want to use all 12 columns individually, you can group the columns together to create wider columns

.center[![Cols](./images/12.png)]

---

slide-title: Boostrap Grid system

- We can decide how many columns we want. Columns must live inside a row.

- It helps to draw out our desired layout first

- Let's start with a simple 4-column design

slide-title: Boostrap Grid system

```html
<body>
  <div class="container">
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-3">
        Some content
      </div>

      <div class="col-3">
        Some more content
      </div>

      <div class="col-3">
        More text here
      </div>

      <div class="col-3">
        Our final column
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
</body>
```

---

slide-title: Multiple rows

Try coding up this layout:

.center[![col](./images/2-rows.png)]

slide-title: Multiple rows

```html
<body>
  <div class="container">
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-6">
        Some content
      </div>

      <div class="col-6">
        Some more content
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-6">
        Some content
      </div>

      <div class="col-6">
        Some more content
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
</body>
```

slide-title: Nested Columns

.center[![col](./images/nested-cols.png)]

---

slide-title: Responsive Design with Bootstrap

- Bootstrap is Mobile first

- The column widths will be applied to **mobile and any sizes above**

- We need to think: "How should the layout look on mobile, and how should it change when the screen gets bigger?"

- This question will help us figure out what row/column structure we want.

slide-title: Responsive Design with Bootstrap

- Bootstrap considers an "extra small screen" to be  less than 576px and an "extra large screen" to be  greater than 1200px

      <div class="col-12 col-sm-4">
        Some content
      </div>

      <div class="col-12 col-sm-4">
        Some more content
      </div>

      <div class="col-12 col-sm-4">
        More text here
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
</body>
```

slide-title: Task

- Have a go at creating the below responsive layout. NB, think about how many rows you actually need!

slide-title: Task Solution

```html
<body>
  <div class="container">
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-12 col-sm-6 purple-rect">
        First column
      </div>
      <div class="col-12 col-sm-6 purple-rect">
        Second column
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-6 blue-rect">
        Always a 6/12 col
      </div>
      <div class="col-6 blue-rect">
        Always a 6/12 col
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
</body>
```

slide-title: Task Solution

- Note how we have also included our own classes, to allow us to add our own styles

```css
.purple-rect {
  height: 200px;
  background-color: plum;
  border: 1px solid lightcoral;
}

.blue-rect {
  height: 200px;
  background-color: lightcyan;
  border: 1px solid lightcoral;
}
```
